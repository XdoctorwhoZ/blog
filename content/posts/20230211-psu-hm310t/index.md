Good power supply for hobbyists. It is cheap and provides a way to control it from a computer but it has some drawbacks. Let's perform some checks.

## Brief

| [Value for money](#value-for-money) | ‚úÖ     | ~125‚Ç¨ when this post was written for a good set of feature |
| [USB Support](#usb-support)         | ‚ùå     | Issue on detection + USB IDs badly customized              |

## Value for money

When I bought this power supply it cost ~125‚Ç¨, and performed everything I needed as a hobbyist. But it seems that it is not a good choice for professional use.

## USB Support

When you plug this power supply into your Linux, the first thing that you can do is the *lsusb* command to see if it has been detected.

```bash
lsusb
# Bus YYY Device XXX: ID 1a86:7523 QinHeng Electronics CH340 serial converter
```

The first check shows that the USB module has NOT been customized, it is still the USB ids of the converter *QinHeng Electronics CH340 serial converter*. The second thing to check is to see if the *serial_short* USB has been modified.

```bash
udevadm info /dev/serial/by-id/usb-1a86_USB_Serial-if00-port0
# ...
# N: ttyUSB0
# ...
# E: MAJOR=188
# E: MINOR=0
# E: SUBSYSTEM=tty
# ...
# E: ID_VENDOR_ID=1a86
# E: ID_MODEL_ID=7523
# ...
# E: ID_SERIAL=1a86_USB_Serial
# ...
```

Ugly ü§Æ! there is no *serial_short*, which means that the ID_SERIAL will be the same if you plug multiple power supplies into your computer and you won't be able to identify it accurately.

### Known Issues: /dev/ttyUSBx is not present in Ubuntu 22.04

On Ubuntu 22, there is a USB conflict, follow this to fix it.

```bash
# EDIT >>> 
/usr/lib/udev/rules.d/85-brltty.rules

# Search for this line and comment it out:
ENV{PRODUCT}=="1a86/7523/*", ENV{BRLTTY_BRAILLE_DRIVER}="bm", GOTO="brltty_usb_run"

# reboot
```

## Control Protocol

This device uses Modbus protocol, here are the register map

**Modbus Registers**

### ON/OFF ‚úÖ

Use *PS_PowerSwitch* to enable or disable the output

### Voltage and Current => Goal Vs Reel üü®

If you want to set the voltage and the current, use PS_SetVoltage and PS_SetCurrent. Those registers set the goal values.
But if you want the real-time values use PS_Voltage and PS_Current.

For example, you can set the current goal value with PS_SetCurrent. This will set the maximum current that the board will get. But to read the real-time consumption of the board, use PS_Current.

### OVP/OCP ‚ùå

I did not find how to enable or disable OVP and OCP through Modbus registers
